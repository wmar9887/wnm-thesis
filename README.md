# wnm-thesis
Repository for my thesis year project. Currently the focus is on formally verifying Block MiniFloat.

# Submission Update
- The last attempt at this work is contained within the jupyter-notebook MiniFloat Current Work.

- All other files are either references used during research, or side projects to help understand the errors arising from attempts.

# Tasks / Goals

- I need to formulate a table to compare my work against what exists.

- I need to list all my literature and tools I have drawn upon.

- I need to implement a small FP calculator which has good accuracy.

- I need to calculate all the intermediate values for this small range.

- Then need to take this small subset and attempt to apply verification processes to it.
	- Might implement something to do with slices of subset since MiniFloat uses a bias.
