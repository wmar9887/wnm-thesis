# wnm-thesis
Repository for my thesis year project. Currently the focus is on a formally verified Block MiniFloat adder.

# Tasks / Goals

- I need to formulate a table to ocmpare my work against what it exists.

- I need to list all my literature and tools I have drawn upon.

- I need to implement a small FP calculator which has good accuracy.

- I need to calculate all the intermediate values for this small range.

- Then need to take this small subset and attempt to apply verification processes to it.
	- Might implement something to do with slices of subset since MiniFloat uses a bias.
